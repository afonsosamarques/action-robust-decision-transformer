# Action Robust Decision Transformer
To install required packages, simply run
```bash
pip install -r action-robust-decision-transformer/requirements.txt
```

Run code as modules from the root dir and not as functions. For example, to run a test run of the pipeline for ardt using some example config, from the 'codebase' directory:
```bash
python3 -m ardt.pipeline --config_name pipeline-example --is_test_run
```
